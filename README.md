# P&D ISSP 2023 base scripts
This repository contains base scripts for the P&D ISSP KU Leuven course, 2023 edition.

Tutorial:

* Make sure Git is installed on your machine.
* Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/p-didier/pandd2023-base` in the folder of your choice.
* You are all set! :)

Repository structure:

* `/package/gui_utils.py`: scripts for the GUI. Not to be modified.
* `/package/general.py`: general functions, not GUI-related. You can add functions to that file to your convenience. Feel free to create other `.py` files as well.
* `/rirs/`: folder where your RIRs and acoustic scenario information will be stored (as Pickle archives: `name.pkl.gz`).
* `/sound_files/`: folder containing provided sound files to conduct your tests.
